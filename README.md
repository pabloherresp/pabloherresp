# 🧑‍💻 Work and experience
I'm looking for a job as a FullStack developer, I have deep knowledge of building solutions with React \ JavaScript \ CSS in the FE, and using Python \ Flask \ SQL in the BE.

Some projects I've worked on:

### [🏞️ Nomadik](https://github.com/pabloherresp/Nomadik-Proyecto-Final-4Geeks-Academy)
A web platform where users can both join and offer activities and excursiones, dividing them into sport, tourism and leisure activities.

From joining activities to asking for a refund or reviewing the ones you've loved the most, Nomadik supports everything you need in order to avoid losing any opportunity of events that you might like.

As a professional user, you can create activities and also check what users have joined your already created ones in order to arrange anything you need.

```
Front-end using React | JS | Bootstrap | CSS
Back-end using Python | Flask | Rest API | SQLAlchemy ORM

Several tools including:
* JWT Authentication
* External API: Stripe API and Google Maps API
* Python libraries: Rapidfuzz, Flask Mail
* Node libraries: MakePDF
```

### 👾 Okkos Invaders
A game based on Space Invaders but using the brand [Okkos](https://okkosworld.com) as the main design for the game.

This was commisioned by an acquitance who owns the brand, as he wanted to take the game inside an arcade to a fashion event ([Scrapworld](https://scrapworld.es)), in order to let customers play the game and compete for a daily prize.

```
Using Godot as the engine
* Chosen for being open-source and multiplatform capabilities (desired future deploy to Okkos web)
* Made using GDScript
* Needed graphics and spritesheets created using GIMP
	- Some of the aliens used for the game are the original designs of the product provided by the brand owner.
* Still pending a deploy to the web and its deploy to [itch.io](itch.io)
```
